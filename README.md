Plan and Logging of Work:
We used the planner app for organizing our work. Jannat took the lead by assigning tasks and setting due dates for each team member. Despite her efforts, we had several challenges along the way. We used to frequently fall behind schedule and also missed personal deadlines, which added stress to the project. However, the planner app proved to be a useful tool in keeping everyone on the same page. It allowed us to stay updated on the progress of each task and to maintain a clear understanding on how everything is going. This level of transparency and coordination among the team helped to stay on the track of completing the project on time.
We have attached the screenshot to the github under planner folder.

Animation Camera and Controls from DEVLOGLOGANâ€™s Video.


We set up the project following DevLogLogan's video tutorial. Starting with importing the robot arm and replacing the node type with Character3D to follow better. Implemented the initial script, which included configuring WASD controls for movement and setting up idle animations to enhance the character's responsiveness. While the camera control setup provided in the video was great, we couldn't get it to work as good and did not meet expectations. After some adjustments and troubleshooting. We managed to refine the camera system to achieve smoother and more intuitive control. Other animations were added too.
